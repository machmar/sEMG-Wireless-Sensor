any frequency higher then 2MHz on the spi clock on the sensor makes it not reliable and unable to send longer messages then 7 bytes, idk why,
hopefully it's just the bad PCB

something is up with the transmission still because in order to reliably transmit 25 bytes I have to send 26 bytes to the nrf chip
this error is consitent for 1MHz and 2MHz

also the app cannot handle 1kHz reliably so rn it's at 500Hz

It just DOES NOT reply to requests, but if it puts them into the fifo itself, it works just fine, I can't figure it out.
