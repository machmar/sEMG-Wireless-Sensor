any frequency higher then 2MHz on the spi clock on the sensor makes it not reliable and unable to send longer messages then 7 bytes, idk why,
hopefully it's just the bad PCB

something is up with the transmission still because in order to reliably transmit 25 bytes I have to send 26 bytes to the nrf chip
this error is consitent for 1MHz and 2MHz
