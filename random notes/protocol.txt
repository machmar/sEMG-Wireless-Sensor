nrf interface:
Set send pipe address, set send data, send, read acks
Set get pipe address, select pipe to listen to, irq read data

protocol:
pipe 0 as fallback, otherwise always pipe 1
sensor always sends sEMG data, the first byte is the type, this is present for all transmists
PC part communicates by transmitting on the same pipe right after sending acks, again the first byte is the type, always
after sending data and getting acks, the device must wait at least as long as it took to send and receive acks to receive any commands.

types:
0x00: sEMG data, measured at 1kHz, when ack is not received, immeadiately store the transmited packet, and any subsequent, transmit on loop until you get a reply
0x01: battery level, responds in percentage
0x02: flash LED
0x03: lead status
0x04: new pipe request, if the accept is not received on the new pipe, fallback
0x05: new pipe accept (the device must store and verify the storage of new pipe before sending this)
0x06: measurement state data byte: 0x00 - stop, 0x01 - start 
0xfd: alive check
0xfe: go to permanent sleep
0xff: extended type, next byte is the type byte

pipes:
fallback  0x1122112233
pipe one  0x1122112201
pipe five 0x1122112205

if no acks are received for 30 seconds, go to fallback sending new pipe request with already set pipe

LEDs:
PC side: flash on serial receive, or data receive
sensor: orange solid on electrode removal, orange blink each n samples sent and acked, flash red on no ack in 30s, on flash LED blink both once
