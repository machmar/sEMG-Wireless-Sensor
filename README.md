# sEMG Wireless Sensor

This repository contains the code and hardware design files for a **wireless surface electromyography (sEMG) sensor**, developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis.

The device is designed to measure muscle activity using non-invasive surface electrodes and transmit the data wirelessly for real-time monitoring and analysis.

Its primary purpose is to assist during exercise by providing greater insight into individual muscle activation and strain.
